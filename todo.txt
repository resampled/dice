* Make forms for everything (post creation first)
* CSS and template overhaul
* Get the AllAuth pages to load the stylesheet, if not, replace em! (could template-in-template be an option?)
--- in the futuer... ---
* Make user list
* Make different sorting methods for list view (most comments, etc.)
